# Ant Colony Optimization for Public Transport Route Replanning

This repository contains the implementation of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to address the challenge of replanning public transport routes in the city of Trento, Italy. ACO, inspired by the cooperative behavior of ants, is a metaheuristic algorithm that has shown success in solving optimization problems, including the famous traveling salesman problem.
